In this assignment, we will learn to train object detectors in the *weakly supervised* setting. For those who don't know what that means - you're going to train object detectors without bounding box annotations!  

We will use the [PyTorch](pytorch.org) framework this time to design our models, train and test them. We will also visualize our predictions using two toolboxes [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) and [Tensorboard](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard) (yes, again!). 
In some questions, I will mention which tool you need to use to visualize. In the other questions where I ask you to visualize things, you can use whichever tool you like.
By the end of the assignment, you'll probably realise that Visdom and Tensorboard are good for visualizing different things.

We will implement two approaches in this assignment:

1. Oquab, Maxime, et al. "*Is object localization for free?-weakly-supervised learning with convolutional neural networks.*" Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2015.
2. Bilen, Hakan, and Andrea Vedaldi. "*Weakly supervised deep detection networks*." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2016.

We will be implementing sligtly simplified versions of these models to make the assignment less threatening.

You should read these papers first. We will train and test both approaches using the [PASCAL VOC 2007](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html) data again. The Pascal VOC dataset comes with bounding box annotations, but we will not be using that for training. 

As always, your task in this assignment is to simply fill in the parts of code, as described in this document, perform all experiments, and submit a report with your results and analyses. We want you to stick to the structure of code we provide.

In all the following tasks, coding and analysis, please write a short summary of what you tried, what worked (or didn't), and what you learned, in the report. Write the code into the files as specified. Submit a zip file (`ANDREWID.zip`) with all the code files, and a single `REPORT.pdf`, which should have commands that TAs can run to re-produce your results/visualizations etc. Also mention any collaborators or other sources used for different parts of the assignment.

## Software setup

If you are using AWS instance setup using the provided instructions, you should already have most of the requirements installed on your machine. In any case, you would need the following python libraries installed:

1. PyTorch (0.4.1)   (*Make sure this version matches - for AWS you can activate the pytorch environment and run ``conda install pytorch=0.4.1``*)
2. TensorFlow
3. Visdom (check Task 0)
4. Numpy
5. Pillow (PIL)
6. And many tiny dependencies that come pre-installed with anaconda or can be installed using ``conda install`` or ``pip install``


## Task 0: Visualization and Understanding the data structures
### Setup conda environment ###

You *must* setup a new conda environment for this assignment and install dependencies. This assignment will be using python 2.7, PyTorch 0.4.1, and cuda 9.2 due to compatibility issues. 
Set up the environment by
```bash
$ conda create --name hw2 python=2.7

# Activate conda pytorch environment.
$ conda activate hw2

# Some conda packages can only be installed from conda-forge (e.g. opencv). So we will be appending conda-forge channel into our conda channels
$ conda config --append channels conda-forge

# Now we'll install the packages we need to run this assignment and compile faster rcnn soon.
$ conda install pip pyyaml sympy h5py cython numpy scipy
$ conda install opencv
$ conda install visdom
$ conda install tensorboardx
$ pip install easydict
$ conda install pytorch=0.4.1 cuda92 -c pytorch
$ conda install torchvision
```

Tip for debugging: since breakpoint() is not available in python 2.7, I suggest using this line of code, which behaves the same as breakpoint:

```bash
$ import traceback as tb
$ import code

tb.print_stack();namespace = globals().copy();namespace.update(locals());code.interact(local=namespace)
```

### Visualization using Visdom
In this assignment, we will use two packages for visualization. In Task 0, we will use [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom).

Please try starting a visdom server first and accessing the board on your local machine. 
You can start a visdom server using:
```bash 
python -m visdom.server -port 8097
```
Now try to open your visdom board one your browser. In your browser, type <aws_instance_public_dns>:<port_number>. 
Example: ec2-3-16-36-2.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8097

If it doesn't load, then you most likely need to configure a security setting for your ec2 instance. Please follow step 6 on this [page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-tensorboard.html).

Now refresh your page and try again. If you still can't load it, please post your error on piazza. 

After setup, it's easy to use Visdom. Here is a simple example:
```python
import visdom
import numpy as np
vis = visdom.Visdom(server='http://address.com',port='8097')
vis.text('Hello, world!')
vis.image(np.ones((3, 10, 10)))
```


### Data structures for the assignment
The codebases for [R-CNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn), [Fast-RCNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn) and [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn) follow a similar structure for organizing and loading data. 
It is *very* highly likely that you will have to work with these codebases if you work on Computer Vision problems.
In this task, we will first try to understand this structure since we will be using the same. Before we try that, we need to setup the code and download the necessary data.

### Data setup
1. First, download the code in this repository.

2. Similar to Assignment 1, we first need to download the image dataset and annotations. If you already have the data from the last assignment, you can skip this step. Use the following commands to setup the data, and lets say it is stored at location `$DATA_DIR`.
```bash
$ # First, cd to a location where you want to store ~0.5GB of data.
$ wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
$ tar xf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
$ # Also download the test data
$ wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar && tar xf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
$ cd VOCdevkit/VOC2007/
$ export DATA_DIR=$(pwd)
```
3. In the main folder of the code provided in this repository, there is an empty directory with the name `data`. 
	- In this folder, you need to create a link to `VOCdevkit` in this folder. 
	- If you read WSDDN paper [2], you should know that it requires bounding box proposals from Selective Search, Edge Boxes or a similar method. We provide you with this data for the assignment. You need to put these proposals in the data folder too.
	
```bash
# You can run these commands to populate the data directory
$ # First, cd to the main code folder
$ # Then cd to the data folder
$ cd data
$ # Create a link to the devkit
$ ln -s <path_to_vocdevkit> VOCdevkit2007
$ # Also download the selective search data
$ wget http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spurushw/hw2_files/selective_search_data.tar && tar xf selective_search_data.tar
```
##

4. Compile the Faster-RCNN codebase:
```bash
$ cd faster_rcnn
$ # Activate conda pytorch environment.
$ ./make.sh
```
(If the above step produces error, report it on piazza). 

Now that we have the code and the data, we can try to understand the main data structures. The data is organized in an object which is an instance of the class `imdb`. You can find the definition of this class in `faster_rcnn/datasets/imdb.py`. For each dataset, we usually create a subclass of `imdb` with specific methods which might differ across datasets. For this assignment, we will use the `pascal_voc` subclass defined in `faster_rcnn/datasets/pascal_voc.py`. 

It is important to understand these data structures since all the data loading for both training and testing depends heavily on this. Before you start using the imdb, you need to compile the codebase (follow instructions in Task 2).
You can create an instance of the `pascal_voc`  class by doing something like this:

```python
	# You can try running these 
	# commands in the python interpreter
	>>> import _init_paths
	>>> from datasets.factory import get_imdb
	>>> imdb = get_imdb('voc_2007_trainval')
```

If you understand it well, you should be able to answer these questions:

#### Q 0.1: What classes does the image at index 2020 contain (index 2020 is the 2021-th image due to 0-based numbering)?
#### Q 0.2: What is the filename of the image at index 2020?

We'll try to use the imdb to perform some simple tasks now.

#### Q 0.3 Use visdom+cv2 to visualize the top 10 bounding box proposals for image at index 2020. You would need to first plot the image and then plot the rectangles for each bounding box proposal.  

#### Q 0.4 Use visdom+cv2 to visualize the ground truth boxes for image at index 2020.
***Hint**: Checkout `vis_detections` in `test.py` for creating the images.*


## Task 1: Is object localization free?
A good way to dive into using PyTorch is training a simple classification model on ImageNet. 
We won't be doing that to save the rainforest (and AWS credits) but you should take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/imagenet/main.py). We will be following the same structure.

All the code is in the ``free_loc`` subfolder. In the code, you need to fill in the parts that say "TODO" (read the questions before you start filling in code). 
We need to define our model in one of the "TODO" parts. We are going to call this ``LocalizerAlexNet``. I've written a skeleton structure in ``custom.py``. You can look at the alexnet example of PyTorch. For simplicity and speed, we won't be copying the FC layers to our model. We want the model to look like this:
```text
LocalizerAlexNet(
  (features): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(11, 11), stride=(4, 4), padding=(2, 2))
    (1): ReLU(inplace)
    (2): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1), ceil_mode=False)
    (3): Conv2d(64, 192, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1), padding=(2, 2))
    (4): ReLU(inplace)
    (5): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(2, 2), dilation=(1, 1), ceil_mode=False)
    (6): Conv2d(192, 384, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (7): ReLU(inplace)
    (8): Conv2d(384, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (9): ReLU(inplace)
    (10): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
    (11): ReLU(inplace)
  )
  (classifier): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (1): ReLU(inplace)
    (2): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))
    (3): ReLU(inplace)
    (4): Conv2d(256, 20, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))
  )
)
```

#### Q 1.1 Fill in each of the TODO parts except for the functions ``metric1``, ``metric2`` and ``LocalizerAlexNetRobust``. In the report, for each of the TODO, describe the functionality of that part. The output of the above model has some spatial resolution. Make sure you read paper [1] and understand how to go from the output to an image level prediction (max-pool). (Hint: This part will be implemented in ``train()`` and ``validate``.

#### Q 1.2 What is the output resolution of the model?

### Plotting using tensorboard from pytorch
For logging to tensorboard, we will be using the [tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) package. Because we're using PyTorch 0.4.1, tensorboard is not included in PyTorch. Don't worry though! Back in the old days we simply used tensorboard from tensorboardX. The usage should be the same.
```python
from tensorboardX import SummaryWriter
writer = SummaryWriter()
# Plots the loss scalar to Tensorboard 
writer.add_scalar('loss', loss_tensor, iteration)
# Similar functions for historgrams, images, etc
```

When you're logging to Tensorboard, make sure you use good tag names. For example, for all training plots you can use ``train/loss``, ``train/metric1``, etc and for validation ``validation/metric1``, etc. This will create separate tabs in Tensorboard and allow easy comparison across experiments.

#### Q 1.3 Initialize the model from ImageNet (till the conv5 layer), initialize the rest of layers with xavier initialization and train the model using batchsize=32, learning rate=0.01, epochs=2 (Yes, only 2 epochs for now).(Hint: also try lr=0.1 - best value varies with implementation of loss)
- Use tensorboard to plot the training loss curve 
- Use Tensorboard to plot images and the rescaled heatmaps for only the GT classes for 2 batches (1 images in each batch) in every epoch (uniformly spaced in iterations). You don't need to plot gradients on any other quantities at the moment.
- Use Visdom to plot images and the rescaled heatmaps for only the GT classes for 2 batches (1 images in each batch) in every epoch (uniformly spaced in iterations). Also add title to the windows as``<epoch>_<iteration>_<batch_index>_image``, ``<epoch>_<iteration>_<batch_index>_heatmap_<class_name>`` (basically a unique identifier)

#### Q 1.4 In the first few iterations, you should observe a steep drop in the loss value. Why does this happen? (Hint: Think about the labels associated with each image).

#### Q 1.5 We will log two metrics during training to see if our model is improving progressively with iterations. The first metric is a standard metric for multi-label classification. Do you remember what this is? Write the code for this metric in the TODO block for ``metric1`` (make sure you handle all the boundary cases). The second metric is more tuned to this dataset. ``metric1`` is to some extent not robust to the issue we identified in Q1.4. So we're going to plot a metric that is not effected by Q1.4. Even though there is a steep drop in loss in the first few iterations ``metric2`` should remain almost constant. Can you name one such metric? Implement it in the TODO block for ``metric2``. (Hint: It is closely related to ``metric1``, make any assumptions needed - like thresholds).

### We're ready to train now!

#### Q 1.6 Initialize the model from ImageNet (till the conv5 layer), initialize the rest of layers with xavier initialization and train the model using batchsize=32, learning rate=0.01, epochs=30. Evaluate every 2 epochs. (Hint: also try lr=0.1 - best value varies with implementation of loss) \[Expected training time: 45mins-75mins].
- IMPORTANT: FOR ALL EXPERIMENTS FROM HERE - ENSURE THAT THE SAME IMAGES ARE PLOTTED ACROSS EXPERIMENTS BY KEEPING THE SAMPLED BATCHES IN THE SAME ORDER. THIS CAN BE DONE BY FIXING THE RANDOM SEEDS BEFORE CREATING DATALOADERS.
- Use Tensorboard to plot the training loss curve, training ``metric1``, training ``metric2``
- Use Tensorboard to plot the mean validation ``metric1`` and mean validation ``metric2`` for every 2 epochs.
- Use Tensorboard to plot images and the rescaled heatmaps for only the GT classes for 2 batches (1 images in each batch) at the end of the 1st, 15th, and last(30th) epoch. 
- Use Tensorboard to plot the histogram of weights and histogram of gradients of weights for all the layers.
- Use Visdom to plot images and the rescaled heatmaps for only the GT classes for 2 batches (1 images in each batch) at the end of the 1st, 15th, and last(30th). Also add title to the windows as``<epoch>_<batch_index>_image``, ``<epoch>_<batch_index>_heatmap_<class_name>`` (basically a unique identifier).
- At the end of training, use Visdom to plot 10 randomly chosen images and corresponding heatmaps (similar to above) from the validation set.
- Report the training loss, training and validation ``metric1`` and ``metric2`` achieved at the end of training (in the report). 


#### Q 1.7 In the heatmap visualizations you observe that there are usually peaks on salient features of the objects but not on the entire objects. How can you fix this in the architecture of the model? (Hint: during training the max-pool operation picks the most salient location). Implement this new model in ``LocalizerAlexNetRobust`` and also implement the corresponding ``localizer_alexnet_robust()``. Train the model using batchsize=32, learning rate=0.01, epochs=45. Evaluate every 2 epochs.(Hint: also try lr=0.1 - best value varies with implementation of loss)
- For this question only visualize images and heatmaps using Tensorboard at similar intervals as before (ensure that the same images are plotted). 
- You don't have to plot the rest of the quantities that you did for previous questions (if you haven't put flags to turn off logging the other quantities, it's okay to log them too - just don't add them to the report).
- In Tensorboard, you can display questions Q1.6 and Q1.7 side by side. This will help you visualize and see if your predictions are improving. 
- At the end of training, use Visdom to plot 10 randomly chosen images (same images as Q1.6) and corresponding heatmaps from the validation set.
- Report the training loss, training and validation ``metric1`` and ``metric2`` achieved at the end of training (in the report). 


## Task 2: Weakly Supervised Deep Detection Networks

First, make sure you understand the WSDDN model. 

We're going to use a combination of many PyTorch-based Faster-RCNN repositories to implement WSDDN. So there are many parts of the code that are not relevant to us.
The main script for training is ``train.py``.  Read all the comments to understand what each part does. There are three major components that you need to work on:

- The data layer ``RoIDataLayer``
- The network architecture and functionality ``WSDDN``
- Visualization using both Tensorboard and Visdom

Tip for task2: conda install tmux, and train in a tmux session. That way you can detach, close your laptop (don't stop your ec2 instance!), and go enjoy a cookie while you wait. Just don't forget to stop your instance after you're done training. It takes approximately 1 hr per 5000 iterations for a k80.

#### Q2.1 In ``RoIDataLayer``, note that we use the ``get_weak_minibatch()`` function. This was changed from  ``get_minibatch`` used in Faster-RCNN. You need to complete the ``get_weak_minibatch`` function defined in ``faster_rcnn/roi_data_layer.py``. 
You can take a look at the ``get_minibatch`` function in the same file for inspiration. Note that the ``labels_blob`` here needs to a vector for each image containing 1s for the classes that are present and 0s for the classes that are not.

#### Q2.2 In ``faster_rcnn/wsddn.py``, you need to complete the  ``__init__, forward`` and `` build_loss`` functions. 

#### Q2.3 In ``train.py`` and ``test.py``, there are places for you perform visualization (search for TODO). You need to perform the appropriate visualizations mentioned here:
In ``train.py``, 

- Plot the loss every 500 iterations using both visdom and tensorboard (don't create new windows in visdom every time).
- Use tensorboard to plot the histogram of weights and histogram of gradients of weights in the model every 2000 iterations
- Use visdom to plot mAP on the *test* set every 5000 iterations. The code for evaluating the model every 5k iterations is not written in ``train.py``. You will have to write that part (look at ``test.py``)
- Plot the class-wise APs in tensorboard every 5000 iterations
- Again make sure you use appropriate tags for tensorboard

In ``test.py``,

- Use tensorboard to plot images with bounding box predictions. Since you evaluate every 5000 iterations during training, this will be plotted automatically during training.

#### Q2.4 Train the model using the settings provided in ``experiments/cfgs/wsddn.yml`` for 20000 iterations.

Include all the code, downloaded images from visdom, tensorboard files and screenshots of tensorboard after training.
Also download images from tensorboard for the last step and add them to the report. Report the final class-wise AP on the test set and the mAP.
